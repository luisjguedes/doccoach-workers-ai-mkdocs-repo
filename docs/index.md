# DocCoach

This site includes a floating **DocCoach** chat button (bottom-right).  
Use it to ask questions about technical writing — or toggle **Include this page** to get feedback grounded in the content you’re reading.

## Try these prompts
- “Give me a checklist to improve this page’s clarity and structure.”
- “Rewrite the intro for a busy engineer.”
- “Extract the key steps as a numbered procedure.”
- “Find ambiguities or missing prerequisites.”

> Tip: If the demo quota is exhausted, the chat may show an error. Come back later (daily reset) or run locally.
